	/*
	In C++, `nullptr` is a special keyword that represents a null pointer of any type.
	On the other hand, `NULL` is a preprocessor macro that is typically defined as `0` or `(void*)0`. 

	1. `fun(nullptr);`: This calls the function `fun` with a `nullptr` argument. Since `nullptr` 
	represents a null pointer of any type, the function `fun(int *ptr)` is a perfect match because 
	it takes a pointer to an `int`. Therefore, this call will invoke the `fun(int *ptr)` overload.

	2. `fun(NULL);`: This calls the function `fun` with a `NULL` argument. The `NULL` macro is typically defined 
	as `0` or `(void*)0`. In this case, the compiler encounters an ambiguity because both `fun(int *ptr)` (taking 
	a pointer to an `int`) and `fun(int x)` (taking an `int`) can be called with an argument of value `0`. 
	The compiler cannot determine which overload to choose, and hence it raises an error stating that the call to `fun(NULL)` is ambiguous.

	To resolve the ambiguity, you can explicitly cast `NULL` to the desired type. For example, 
	if you want to call `fun(int *ptr)`, you can cast `NULL` to `int*` as follows: `fun(static_cast<int*>(NULL));`. 
	Alternatively, you can use `nullptr`, which is the preferred way in modern C++: `fun(nullptr);`.
